# F**k you, I am over 35 years old

## Background
This is more and more hot high-tech companies in China take for granted that if the candidate's age is over 35, he/she will be considered at all, even if the candidate was asked politely whether he/she want to change at first. This terrible practice caused huge anxieties and discouraged many youngers to stop theirs career prematurely and prevent more talents from joining the industry. This is what we want to change.

## Program
This is the program we believe:

0. Value cannot be valued by age
0. Over 35 is just the most creative age for most of industries and persons, such limititaion is ridiculous
0. Exploitating youngers under 35 with [996.icu](https://996.icu/#/en_US) just because they can is inhumane & violate the civil law
0. We believed that age discrimination is bad to everyone and it's especial unfair for woman workers
0. Ask for under-35 is a shame, not a privilege
0. Those who asks for under-35 is not deserved works for


## Action
We need move and make the voice for all persons as they would suffer this soon or later. The actions include:

0. we call up for the attention and let the silent most hearable now
1. we maintain a black-list of such companies (including evidence) and warn any applicant, parter and provider
2. we ask those over-35 professional leaders give talk about career development  
3. we respect those honest componies and would like recommend them
